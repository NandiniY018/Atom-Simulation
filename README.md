# Atom-Simulation

Atom Simulation (OpenGL Mini Project) is a C-based program using OpenGL (GLUT) that visually simulates the atomic structure of elements from Hydrogen (Z=1) to Neon (Z=10). 
It features interactive orbiting electrons, a right-click menu for selecting elements, starting/stopping the simulation, and window controls. Keyboard shortcuts allow navigation,
rotation control, and fullscreen toggling. The project runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with a compatible C/C++ compiler and OpenGL/GLUT installed. Users can select elements,
start animations, and explore electron movement in real time.
